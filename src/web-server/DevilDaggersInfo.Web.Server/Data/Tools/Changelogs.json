Back then, partial mods were not supported. With this tool you can make your old binary file a lot smaller by leaving out all the unchanged assets, which can be done by comparing it against the original binary. The tool can be found under Tools > Trim binary file."

It is no longer required to create a binary file containing all assets. It also allows you to load multiple partial mods simultaneously. You can, for instance, load a partial mod that only changes the texture for Skull I, and then load another mod that changes the texture for the arena tiles."

Mod files are now saved under a unified extension named .ddae, which holds all asset data even if your mod does not specify, for example, particle assets. The easiest way to migrate is just to re-import your assets and save it as a .ddae file."

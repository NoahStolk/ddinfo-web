		This is an alpha version of the rewritten tools.
		It is still very much a work in progress.

		I also do not have a deadline or schedule for these developments,
		and there will not be an official release date any time soon.

		If you encounter any problems, please report them on Discord/GitHub.

		Thank you for testing!

		NOTE: This feature is VERY EXPERIMENTAL and may never fully work.

		For now, it only tries to make an approximation for the player movement.
		Tile collisions, bhops, air control, and dagger jumps are still missing however.

		Enemy movement is not simulated at all and this most likely won't be implemented.

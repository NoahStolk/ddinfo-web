<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Replay Editor</h3>

<p class="para">
	The first alpha version of the Replay Editor has been released! It's still in a very early development stage, so don't expect much. It is in fact just a viewer for now, and not an actual editor.
</p>

<p class="para">
	If you're interested in testing or playing with it, check it out <a class="link" href="/tools/replay-editor">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="para">
	This is also the first app that can run natively on Linux (and Mac). I still need to implement a few Linux-specific things, but I will release a Linux version later. All the other apps will eventually use the same technology for their rewrites.

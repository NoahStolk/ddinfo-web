	DevilDaggers.info version 5 has been released! This is probably the biggest milestone the project has ever had and I'm very happy about it. After 6 months of working on V5, it is finally time to replace the V4 website (which ran from mid 2018 to early 2022) with newer and better technology.

	Almost every feature has been ported to the new website. I'll port the remaining small features soon. This weekend I'll be focusing on getting everything up and running, cleaning up all the old stuff, and fixing any potential issues.

<p class="para">
	I'll also be working on improved performance shortly. For now I'd like to get rid of the old website as soon as possible.

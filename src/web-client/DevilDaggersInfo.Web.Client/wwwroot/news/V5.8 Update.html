<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">New Custom Leaderboards Features</h3>

<p class="para">
	It is now possible to have custom leaderboards that are sorted by amount of gems, kills, or homing.
</p>

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Enhancements</h3>

<p class="para">
	Banned players (meaning bans tracked by DevilDaggers.info, not "official" bans) are now skipped when determining world records, world record holders, and player progression (rank and score).
</p>

<p class="para">
	This means that if your world record is beaten by a banned player, you will not lose your world record. Or if your best rank is 101 on the leaderboard history, but the player at rank 100 is banned, your best rank will be set to 100.
</p>

<p class="para">
	This is effective immediately for all history whenever a player is banned or unbanned.
</p>

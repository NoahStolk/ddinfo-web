<ol class="pl-4">

	<li class="list-decimal">Navigate to the <span class="path">mods</span> folder where Devil Daggers is installed. On Windows, this is <span class="path">C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\devildaggers\mods</span> by default if you are using Steam. In this folder, there should be a file named <span class="path">put mods here.txt</span>.</li>

	<li class="list-decimal">Click on the spawnset you want to play.</li>

	Welcome to DevilDaggers.info, a website specifically made for the game <a class="link" href="//store.steampowered.com/app/422970/Devil_Daggers/" target="_blank">Devil Daggers</a>.
</p>
<img class="w-64 h-64 m-4" src="/images/home/logo.gif" />
<p class="py-1">
	This is a fan-made website; the creator of this website is not related to the developers of Devil Daggers. Devil Daggers is a game created by Sorath, and <a class="link" href="//devildaggers.com/" target="_blank">devildaggers.com</a> is the official website for the game.
</p>
<p class="py-1">
	I first launched this website in early 2017 as a small hobby project. It started as a simple leaderboard page, so people could view the leaderboard without opening the game. Later I added wiki pages for spawns, hand upgrades, enemy types, and dagger types. After that I began hosting custom spawnsets, which allow modifications of the enemy spawns and arena of the main game. I developed a <a class="link" href="/tools/survival-editor">spawnset editor</a> to create spawnsets more easily, and some time later created and began hosting <a class="link" href="/custom/leaderboards">custom leaderboards</a> for them.
</p>
<p class="py-1">
	Since then, I've expanded the project quite a bit, adding leaderboard history, world record progression, statistics, the possibility to mod the assets of the game, and much more.
</p>
<p class="py-1">
	All of this would not have been possible without such a dedicated and helpful community. Thank you.

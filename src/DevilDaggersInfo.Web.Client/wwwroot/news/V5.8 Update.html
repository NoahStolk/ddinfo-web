<p class="para">
	This is a summary of the changes that have been made in 2023 and 2024. Many of these were already released last year, but I never got around to writing a news post about all of this.
</p>

<p class="para">
	There have also been significant updates to <a href="/tools">ddinfo-tools</a>. You can read about all that on GitHub.

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">New Custom Leaderboards Features</h3>

<p class="para">
	It is now possible to have custom leaderboards that are sorted by:
</p>

<ul class="py-2 pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">gems collected</li>
	<li class="list-disc">gems despawned</li>
	<li class="list-disc">gems eaten</li>
	<li class="list-disc">enemies killed</li>
	<li class="list-disc">enemies alive</li>
	<li class="list-disc">homing stored</li>
	<li class="list-disc">homing eaten</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Enhancements</h3>

<p class="para">
	Banned players (meaning bans tracked by DevilDaggers.info, not "official" bans) are now skipped when determining world records, world record holders, and player progression (rank and score).
</p>

<p class="para">
	This means that if your world record is beaten by a banned player, you will not lose your world record. Or if your best rank is 101 on the leaderboard history, but the player at rank 100 is banned, your best rank will be set to 100.
</p>

<p class="para">
	This is effective immediately for all history whenever a player is banned or unbanned.
</p>

<h3 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Fixes</h3>

<ul class="py-2 pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">Fixed highlighting the highest WR instead of the most recent one (in case the previous WR was removed).</li>
</ul>

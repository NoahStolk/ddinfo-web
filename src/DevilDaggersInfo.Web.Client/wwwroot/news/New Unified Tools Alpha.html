<p class="para">For the past few months I have been working on a new app. Its goal is to eventually replace all the current tools (all editors and the custom leaderboards recorder) and include a lot of QOL improvements. The new app is cross-platform will simply be called DDINFO TOOLS.</p>
<p class="para">It is currently in development and an alpha build for Windows can be downloaded <a class="link" href="/tools">here</a>. A Linux build will be available later if anyone wants to help test it.</p>
<p class="para">At this point, only support for custom leaderboards has been fully implemented. There is also a working survival editor (still a work in progress) which includes some new stuff as well, such as a 3D editor, full undo and redo support, more editing tools, etc.</p>

<h4 class="text-red text-xl pt-4 pb-2 font-goethe">Advantages over deprecated tools</h4>

<ol class="py-2 pl-4">
	<li class="list-disc">A single application instead of three separate ones.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Cross-platform instead of Windows-only. The app already runs on Linux, but it's still missing some native implementations for now. Support for Mac is also possible if anyone wants it, I just don't have a Mac to test it on so I'd need some help with that.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Automatic updates.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Way smaller download size; ~9 MB for all the tools combined instead of ~165 MB. No prerequisites needed.</li>
	<li class="list-disc">Way faster startup time compared to the previous editors.</li>
</ol>

<p class="para">As always, the code is open source and can be found on <a class="link" href="https://github.com/NoahStolk/ddinfo-tools" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. For more info, check the <a class="link" href="/tools">tools</a> page.</p>
